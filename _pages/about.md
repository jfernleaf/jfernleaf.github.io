I am a fourth-year undergrad student at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and minoring in human-computer interaction (HCI). I am most interested in the research and development of accessibility tools to help support people with disabilities in their daily lives. I am a part of [Transportation, Bots, and Disability (TBD) Lab](https://tbd.ri.cmu.edu/). I am also a Founder and Chair of the Accommodations for Blind and Deaf Students Subcommittee, as well as a member of the School of Computer Science Dean's Undergraduate Advisory Committee.
