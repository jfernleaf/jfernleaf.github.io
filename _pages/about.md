Hi, I’m Fern! I’m a 3rd year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Yale University. I’m a member of the [Social Robotics Lab](https://scazlab.yale.edu/), supervised by Brian Scassellati. My research focuses on using robots to understand and promote prosocial dynamics. I am currently designing behaviors for a social robot to engage seniors living with dementia and their care partners in emotion regulation activities. I am excited about creating and using technology that helps people to improve their daily lives. I am also currently serving in Yale Computer Science Graduate Student Advisory Committee. 

I completed my B.S. in artificial intelligence (AI) with a concentration in human-computer interaction (HCI) at Carnegie Mellon University in 2022, where I was academically advised by Reid Simmons. At Carnegie Mellon, I was a member of the [Transportation, Bots, and Disability (TBD) Lab](https://tbd.ri.cmu.edu/), supervised by Aaron Steinfeld. Additionally, I was a member of the School of Computer Science Dean’s Undergraduate Advisory Committee, as well as a founder and chair of the Accommodations for Blind and Deaf Students Subcommittee.

I am passionate about advocating for better accessibility of daily activities for people with disabilities. I was a part of the [Disability Pride PA Committee](https://www.disabilitypridepa.org/), which organizes events across Pennsylvania.
