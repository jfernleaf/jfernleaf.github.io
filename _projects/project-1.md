Navigating in complex indoor spaces like train stations, shopping malls, and university buildings can be challenging for people with visual impairments, since current path planning approaches rely on users to spontaneously adjust their trajectories based on their visual knowledge. To help a user with a visual impairment rendezvous with a static object (e.g., a waiting robot, a kiosk, or an autonomous car at the curbside) in a seamless way, we propose an approach that can incorporate information about the userâ€™s position and orientation from sensors attached to the environment, nearby robots, or cars to dynamically plan and give users instructions of how to reach their goal.
