This CS TA Seminar is on a brand new topic, "How to Better Support Students with Accommodations", at 5:30 p.m. by Lauren Johnson and I.

Abstract: Our goal is to welcome students from various backgrounds who come in with different sets of abilities.  This talk will discuss the responsibilities of TAs when it comes to interacting with students' academic accommodations, and issues such as appropriate vs inappropriate questions about their accommodations.  We will also debunk some of the common myths and misconceptions about students with disabilities to give everyone a deeper understanding of students who have academic accommodations with the Office of Disability Resources.
